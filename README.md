Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This file loads up a function that takes the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" by Jorge L. and turns it into a tidy dataset consisting of the mean of the mean accelerometer and gyroscope data for each group, subject number and subject activity.

To run this program, source it in R and then run the LoadUCIdataSet function.  

If the "UCI HAR DataSet" isn't in your current working directory, you may input the filepath into the function for it to call the data and run the function.
